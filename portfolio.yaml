  about:
    - I designed & built a Twitter bot that generates random fanta cans. It works by randomly choosing an emoji from <code title="Twitter's emoji library">twemoji</code>, then generating a color pallette from it, and finally putting together an image and tweets it. The whole thing is built as a webpage that gets screenshotted, meaning all you see is CSS & HTML <em>(Turns out CSS can do layer blending modes now!)</em>
    - All the branding elements are thoughtfully handcrafted, I even obtained the Coca-Cola fonts from their press release to do the <strong>Zero Sugar</strong> bit. Only to then find out Fanta uses a custom variation. This culminated in me tweaking the vectors for hours to get it looking close enough. As far as I'm aware, while the bot receives a lot of criticism for implying clouds are edible, nobody has pointed out the typography is slightly off.
