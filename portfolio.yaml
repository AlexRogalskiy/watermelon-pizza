  about:
    - I designed & built a Twitter bot that generates random fanta cans. It works by randomly choosing an emoji from <code title="Twitter's emoji library">twemoji</code>, then generating a color pallette from it, and finally putting together an image and tweets it. The whole thing is built as a webpage that gets screenshotted, meaning all you see is CSS & HTML <em>(Turns out CSS can do layer blending modes now!)</em>
    - All the branding elements are thoughtfully handcrafted, I even obtained the Coca-Cola fonts from their press release to do the <strong>Zero Sugar</strong> bit. Only to then find out Fanta uses a custom variation. This culminated in me tweaking the vectors for hours to get it looking close enough. As far as I'm aware, while the bot receives a lot of criticism for implying clouds are edible, nobody has pointed out the typography is slightly off.

  about:
    - In addition to Fake Fantas I've also built a number of smaller Twitter bots, most of them built around generating HTML & CSS. Some of these work better as code showcases than as functional robots.
    - Some are very basic, like <strong>@twistmeknickers</strong> which will try to britishize words, to an awful effect. Others like <strong>@textbotbook</strong> try to make textbooks.
    - <strong>@pancakesorwaffl</strong> <em>(which generates video game moral choices)</em>, has a terrible dictionary, but pushes HTML+CSS to the limit. It has about 10 different UIs recreated in it, with rainbow text or 3D effects.

  about:
    - Index is TNW's data platform. It aggregates information on <strong>startups, brands, and investors</strong>. From 2015 to 2017 I was part of the small team that started it, as client-side developer and designer. In its early stages this project was highly experimental, and had a huge backlog of features and tests the team was keen to run.

        - Despite the complex, Facebook-Like layout and different pages, every component in Index works across all breakpoints without a hitch. Very early on the team championed building every feature from, or into, a library of extremely flexible, responsive, reusable components.

        - The design language is powerful yet playful. It scales from simple consumption views to complex multilayered forms.

        - While sporting a flashier look, even promotional pages are part of the component system, gaining access to shared buttons, forms, and layout tools.
